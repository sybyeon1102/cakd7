            <p>Bonobono (ぼのぼの) is a yonkoma manga series by Mikio Igarashi. From March 1986 to March 1987, the series ran in the Takeshobo manga magazine Tensai Club before the magazine was replaced with Manga Club, where it had been serialized from April 1987 to April 2020. It is also been serialized in Manga Life since April 1986. It has been adapted into an anime television series,[3] as well as two anime films and two video games.[1][2]</p>
            <p>While the series is considered a yonkoma manga, most of the "stories" use eight panels. The series follows the main character, a young sea otter after whom the manga is titled, and his daily adventures with his friends from the nearby forest. Bonobono combines gag comic and philosophical questions, bringing up comparisons to other manga such as Azumanga Daioh,[4] and to films such as Forrest Gump.[5]</p>
            <p>In 1988, Bonobono won the Kodansha Manga Award in the General category.[6] An anime film was released in theaters on November 13, 1993, and an anime television series was broadcast on TV Tokyo from April 20, 1995 through March 28, 1996. One day after the TV series began, a simulation game was released on the 3DO system.[1] The following June, an adventure game was released on the PlayStation.[2] Several ehon—or "picture books"—have been released since the manga series was first introduced over 30 years ago.</p>
